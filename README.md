## Building the Application

```sh
# checkout a tag
git checkout v1.1.0

# install dependencies
npm install

# execute all checks (lint, test and build)
npm run all

# build the application to ./dist
npm run build
```


### Development Setup

Spin up the application for development, all strings attached:

```sh
npm run dev
```


## Upstream Sync

We use a `sync` task to keep up with changes in the upstream [Camunda Modeler](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-modeler) repository. Execute it via:

```sh
npm run sync
```

If no merge conflicts appeared, the synchronization task is done and the changes can be pushed remotely. If there were merge conflicts detected, the task automatically exclude unrelated files from the conflicts (e.g. changes inside `tabs/bpmn/*`). Other merge conflicts must be resolved manually.
